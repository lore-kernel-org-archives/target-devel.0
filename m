This is regular behavior during multi PDU login sequences, and should
not include a WARN_ON.

So with MNC's Tested-by in place, applying to target-pending/for-next
minus the WARN_ON, with a extra 4.14.y stable tag.

Thanks again for taking a look at this.

To your earlier point wrt net.ipv4.tcp_low_latency=1 on 4.13 code not
triggering pre-queue logic.  From groking the original patch to drop
prequeue I agree this should really be the case, but am still at a loss
how MNC is triggering on 4.14+ unless something else has changed to
uncover this iscsi-target bug.

Still curious to verify the root cause, but I haven't been able to
reproduce this in VMs on small scale, and haven't had cycles to
reproduce on HW yet.

That said, since the bug appears to be masked on <= 4.13.y +
tcp_low_latency=1, unless someone can reproduce this on earlier code
with tcp_low_latency=0, I'll leave off the older stable tag for now.
