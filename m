Hi Michael,

The initiator was CentOS 7.x with distro kernel (3.10.0-x). There were
two cases:
 * Initiatalization [1] and online resize of ext4 filesystem [2]
   use WRITE SAME [3] for zeroing. TCM doesn't support RSOC, so
   the initiator defaults to using WRITE SAME (10). The filesystem
   showed errors after online resize;
 * a WRITE SAME command for the last LBA was stuck in multipath. TCM
   always returned LOGICAL UNIT NOT SUPPORTED for the command. The
   resason of the response is because some bios were sent beyond the
   sector limit. WRITE SAME with NUMBER OF LOGICAL BLOCKS = 1 was
   failing for the last 7 LBAs.

It did not support zero out and write same, both
write_zeroes_max_bytes/write_same_max_bytes = 0

Yes, I triaged the issues above with sg_write_same/sg_dd and non-zero
buffer.
