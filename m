Primarily because I wanted to extend sgl_alloc_order slightly in order 
to be able to use it from i915. And then in the process noticed a couple 
of bugs in the implementation, type inconsistencies and unused exported 
symbols. That gave me a feeling API could actually use a bit of work.

sgl_alloc_order never does this.

However there is a different bug in my patch relating to the last entry 
which can have shorter length from the rest. So get_order on the last 
entry is incorrect - I have to store the deduced order and carry it over.

In which case it may even make sense to refactor sgl_alloc_order a bit 
more to avoid wastage on the last entry with high order allocations.
