I know, that is why both you and Maurizio in To: field. I want from
you some comments. Thank you for review.

As I said in response to sashiko-bot, that is the current (always be) behavior.
It is not introduced by my patch.

Not the same, d5869dae5080 greatly increases the probability of the
double completion by calling target_complete_cmd() which is allowed to be
called only once for the cmd. Calling it twice is wrong by nature. Fabric
module shall call either target_execute_cmd() either
transport_generic_request_failure(). target_complete_cmd() is for
backstore modules. That target_complete_cmd() at the iscsi
connection release is not so good too. But it was intended to be the
last(and the only) call from fabric driver for the command never be in
the target core.

My intention is to not create a situation when there a race is possible
instead of fixing those races.

No, transport_send_check_condition_and_sense will change t_state, send
status and decrease cmd->refcnt and then unblock wait_for_completion of
ABORT/LUN_RESET. Both the commnand and ABORT of that command will be
completed sucessfully.
Noone calls target_handle_abort().

That is a idea for a future discussion and improvmens. This patchset is
narrowed to just to fix the stuck of WRITE_PENDING commands.

The abort of WRITE_PENDIG command in the state waiting for DataOuts
currently will wait for the data completion. So, my patch again does not
do worse.

My patch is more than 2 years old in customers setups, but certainly
it would be great to test it in other environments too.

BR,
 Dmitry
