In general most of the zeroing here should go away entirely.  Right
now that code is a bit convolute due to the fake EH scsi command that
also uses scsi_init_command.  Once that is sorted out (I've just pinged
Hannes for his series) scsi_init_command can be folded into
scsi_prepare_cmd and a lot more of this can be cleaned up.
