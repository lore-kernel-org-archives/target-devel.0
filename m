The issue doesn't happen on 4.15-rc4 with mlx4, but it does with cxgb4.  There have been some bad problems with cxgb4's drain logic, so I need to just root cause this, because backing up to see if it used to work is problematic and will hit other issues with drain.  The qp does get drained, and I confirmed it has no pending send or recv wrs.  The associated cq's last 2 completions are from the ib_drain_qp() logic, so I need to somehow determine what completion got lost/dropped/whatever. 

Do you have any thoughts on debugging this?  Turning on isert debug is bad because the IO load is very high.  I sort of need something that I can do after it gets stuck.  So I can change the wait_for_completion() to a wait_for_completion_timeout() and if it times out, go figure out what it is stuck on.
