This snipit from isert_put_cmd() looks interesting:

...
                        /*
                         * Check for special case during comp_err where
                         * WRITE_PENDING has been handed off from core,
                         * but requires an extra target_put_sess_cmd()
                         * before transport_generic_free_cmd() below.
                         */
                        if (comp_err &&
                            cmd->se_cmd.t_state = TRANSPORT_WRITE_PENDING) {
                                struct se_cmd *se_cmd = &cmd->se_cmd;

                                target_put_sess_cmd(se_cmd);
                        }
...
