If we cannot setup a cmd because we run out of ring space
or global pages release the blocks before sleeping. This
prevents a deadlock where dev0 has waiting_blocks set and
needs N blocks, but dev1 to devX have each allocated N / X blocks
and also hit the global block limit so they went to sleep.

find_free_blocks is not able to take the sleeping dev's
blocks becaause their waiting_blocks is set and even
if it was not the block returned by find_last_bit could equal
dbi_max. The latter will probably never happen because
DATA_BLOCK_BITS is so high but in the next patches
DATA_BLOCK_BITS and TCMU_GLOBAL_MAX_BLOCKS will be settable so
it might be lower and could happen.
