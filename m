Hi Matthew,

I love your patch! Perhaps something to improve:

[auto build test WARNING on linus/master]
[also build test WARNING on v4.17-rc5 next-20180516]
[cannot apply to target/master]
[if your patch is applied to the wrong git tree, please drop us a note to help improve the system]

reproduce:
        # apt-get install sparse
        make ARCH=x86_64 allmodconfig
        make C=1 CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__


sparse warnings: (new ones prefixed by >>)

>> drivers/target/iscsi/iscsi_target_util.c:150:5: sparse: symbol 'iscsit_wait_for_tag' was not declared. Should it be static?
   drivers/target/iscsi/iscsi_target_util.c:1174:31: sparse: expression using sizeof(void)
   drivers/target/iscsi/iscsi_target_util.c:1174:31: sparse: expression using sizeof(void)

Please review and possibly fold the followup patch.
