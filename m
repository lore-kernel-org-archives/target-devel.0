Subject: [RFC] [PATCH] LIO: Add emulate_removable attribute
Date:   Mon,  8 Feb 2021 13:54:08 -0500

The following patch adds an additional attribute to the LIO confgfs
allowing you to cause the disk to report that it is removable.

It currently works but to get the sd driver to register the change in
the removable bit in the IDENTIFY data, you have to tap the delete
sysfs knob to unbind it and then trigger the host to rescan.  Is there
a way to trigger this when the attribute is changed?

I noticed that the attributes show up in configfs under the fileio
backing store rather than the disk lun, which seems like the wrong
place.  Why is this?

Also targetcli does not seem to know about these attributes.
Shouldn't it?  Or did I just miss it?
