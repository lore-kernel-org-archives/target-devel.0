Roman,

The patch looks ok to me. Just one question. How did you hit this?

Did you by any chance export this disk to a ESX initiator and was it
doing WRITE SAME to zero out data. But, did the device being used by
iblock not support the zero out command (was
/sys/block/XYZ/queue/write_zeroes_max_bytes = 0)?

Or, did you just send a WRITE SAME command manually using some tools
like sg utils and it had a non zero'd buffer to write out?

Or, was it some other use case?
