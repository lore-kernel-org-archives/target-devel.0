How much does this increase the kernel code by?

You are also replicating a lot of code making it more
difficult to maintain.

I don't think the performance of an socket option code
really matters - it is usually done once when a socket
is initialised and the other costs of establishing a
connection will dominate.

Pulling the user copies outside the [gs]etsocksopt switch
statement not only reduces the code size (source and object)
and trivially allows kernel_[sg]sockopt() to me added to
the list of socket calls.

It probably isn't possible to pull the usercopies right
out into the syscall wrapper because of some broken
requests.

I worried about whether getsockopt() should read the entire
user buffer first. SCTP needs the some of it often (including a
sockaddr_storage in one case), TCP needs it once.
However the cost of reading a few words is small, and a big
buffer probably needs setting to avoid leaking kernel
memory if the structure has holes or fields that don't get set.
Reading from userspace solves both issues.
