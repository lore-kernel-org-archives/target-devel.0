Hi Ram,

CC'ing target-devel where isert is normally maintained.

Indeed, and should not happen.

That would trigger a DEVICE_REMOVAL event. which should trigger free of
the iser connection (and its relevant rdma resources, including the qp).

Correct.

It is valid in theory, but isert should never get there. isert always
drains the queue-pair before freeing it. ib_drain_qp() is designed to
guarantee that after calling it, no other completion will ever be
associated with the qp.

There are two possibilities here:
1. We have a bug in isert which posts a wr after calling ib_drain_qp()
which is very likely, but given that this is a recv completion I sorta
doubt it because it means that the QP is not even in error state (or is
it and its an FLUSH error completion?)

2. The device you tested with did not really drain the qp properly and a
stray completion found its way afterwards. What device did you test
with?

As I said, isert should make sure to not get there ever and uses
ib_drain_qp for it.
