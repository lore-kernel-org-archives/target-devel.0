I don't really think this is helpful.  The first question is, is the
implied might be NULL check correct?  The tpg_tiqn is always set by a
non-dummy driver and I think network configuration is only done for the
non dummy driver, so I suspect the NULL check is wrong.  Secondly even
if the NULL check were correct, I think there's still a need for some
debugging output, so the proposed patch also looks wrong.
