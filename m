I missed this patch going through.
Massive NACK.

You need to export functions that do most of the socket options
for all protocols.
As well as REUSADDR and NODELAY SCTP has loads because a lot
of stuff that should have been extra system calls got piled
into setsockopt.

An alternate solution would be to move the copy_to/from_user()
into a wrapper function so that the kernel_[sg]etsockopt()
functions would bypass them completely.
