I'd guess that most application use the correct size for setsockopt().
(Well, apart from using 4 instead of 1.)

It is certainly possible to always try to read in 64 bytes
regardless of the supplied length, but handle the EFAULT case
by shortening the buffer.

Historically getsockopt() only wrote the length back.
Treating 0 and garbage as (say) 4k and letting the protocol
code set a shorten the copy to user might work.
All short transfers would want to use an on-stack buffer,
so slight oversizes could also be allowed for.

OTOH if i did a getsockopt() with too short a length I wouldn't
want the kernel to trash my program memory.
