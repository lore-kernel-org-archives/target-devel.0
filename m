I am going take this into -RT tree for now until we have different
solution. I will try to be kind and do the same change in
__transport_wait_for_tasks().
Arnaldo, please do "[PATCH RT]" while sending patches. Then the bots
don't complain if it applies but does not compile on !RT kernel (or so
I've been told).

Technically speaking the code wants to ensure that the lock is held and
the interrupts are disabled because the lock is always taken with
disabled interrupts. This kind of check could be done with
	lockdep_assert_held(&cmd->t_state_lock);

but would require lockdep to be switched on. Nicholas, would you mind
such a change?
