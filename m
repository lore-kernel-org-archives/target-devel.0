Yes. With David's patch, which is doing that, it can be as simple as:

static int sctp_bind_add(struct sock *sk, struct sockaddr *addr,
               int addrlen)
{
	int ret;
	lock_sock(sk);
	ret = sctp_setsockopt_bindx(sk, addr, addrlen, SCTP_BINDX_ADD_ADDR);
	release_sock(sk);
	return ret;
}

and then dlm would be using code that we can test through sctp-only tests as
well.

Right, okay.
