Sorry for the late reply,

Can we go back and understand why do we need to limit isert transfer
size? I would suggest that we handle queue-full scenarios instead
of limiting the transfered payload size.

 From the trace Shiraz sent, it looks that:
a) we are too chatty when failing to post a wr on a queue-pair
(something that can happen by design), and
b) isert escalates to terminating the connection which means we
screwed up handling it.

Shiraz, can you explain these messages:
[17066.397206] i40iw i40iw_process_aeq ae_id = 0x503 bool qp=1 qp_id = 3
[17066.397247] i40iw i40iw_process_aeq ae_id = 0x501 bool qp=1 qp_id = 3

Who is initiating the connection teardown? the initiator or the target?
(looks like the initiator gave up on iscsi ping timeout expiration)

Nic,
Currently, what I see is that queue-full handler simply schedules qf
work to re-issue the I/O again. The issue is that the only way that
a new send queue entry becomes available again is that isert process
one or more send completions. If at all, this work is interfering with
the isert_send_done handler.

Will it be possible that some transports will be able to schedule
qf_work_queue themselves? I guess It would also hold if iscsit were to
use non-blocking sockets and continue at .write_space()?

Something like transport_process_wait_list() that would be triggered
from the transport completion handler (or from centralize place like
target_sess_put_cmd or something...)?

Also, I see that this wait list is singular accross the se_device. Maybe
it would be a better idea to have it per se_session as it maps to iscsi
connection (or srp channel for that matter)? For large I/O sizes this
should happen quite a lot so its a bit of a shame that we need will
to compete over the list_empty check...

If we prefer to make this go away by limiting the transfer size then its
fine I guess, but maybe we can do better? (although it can take some
extra work...)

I think its an easier fix for sure. What I don't know, is weather this
introduces a regression for devices that can handle more sges on large
I/O sizes. I very much doubt it will though...
