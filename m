Just the CommitDate on all of them as I said.  The main problem is that
it's 4 November and there's no other commit activity for an earlier
date in this merge window cycle.

A tree is judged on the trustworthiness of its maintainer. Linus uses
process, feedback, regression handling and other markers to make that
assessment.  Having a three month gap in the CommitDate indicates a
haphazard approach to the process of maintaining the tree.

Neither has actually caught up fully to your tree yet, if you check so
the results should start coming in soon.

OK, so did you have anyone in mind?
