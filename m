Ah, I missed that, sorry.

Why not just take a week and do that?  I can't take any new patches
until 4.17-rc1 is out anyway.

Again, why not just take the time to do that?

Have you asked the scsi developers what they think about this?

And why not copy the staging developer mailing list on this patch
series?

I'll take anything in staging as long as it has the correct license and
builds, that's not an issue :)  But I do want to get agreement from the
SCSI maintainers that this is ok to have in this part of the kernel as
sometimes it can cause merge issues if there are core api changes.

A respin of this would be nice, and again, I can't do anything with it
until 4.17-rc1 is out.
