Yeah, needs more work. I especially don't like that case (as in any 
other with a final short chunk) wasting memory. So it would need more 
refactoring to make it possible.

It did work in my internal tree where sgl_alloc_order was extended to 
become sgl_alloc_order_min_max, and as such uses a smaller order for 
smaller chunks.

This patch can be dropped for now but the earlier ones are still valid I 
think. On those one I think we have some opens on how to proceed so if 
you could reply there, where applicable, that would be great.

Tvrtko
